## What is Lettuce AI?

Lettuce is a small project for private roleplay chats. We make a simple client that lets you write stories your way while keeping control of models, providers, and data.

We want to give writers a direct platform for interactive stories. The client works with different language models but keeps your conversations, characters, and plots completely yours. Fantasy adventures, character work, or complex stories. Lettuce provides the tools without getting in your way.

You provide your own API tokens, which means you connect directly to the services you choose. No middleman, no data collection, no restrictions on your content.

We focus on privacy, customization, and creative freedom. Your data belongs to you, your stories stay private, and you pick the models and providers that fit your creative work.
